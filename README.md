# Project 4

The final projected has been finished. The game has audio on all pages (of the project.) The audio is a little loud so be careful when you open up the pages. The documentation page is only accessed through the navigation page. There is also a highscore system that requires you to clear your cookies everytime you start fresh. If you want to continue to play the game and beat the highscore then there is no need to clear cookies. 

This has been said in the documentation page, but I will also post it here for more clarity:

Each song is not mine and I do not own any of it. The navigation page song is called Ghed'ahre composed by Aaron Walz and is from the game Aveyond: The Orbs of Magic Series. The easy mode song is Hexenaccht by Phyrnna. The hard mode song is Demons by Zed's Dead and the instructions page song is called Underfall composed by Aaron Walz from the same game.The documentation page song takes a turn to a more epic song called Empire of Angels (Sun) composed by Thomas Bergersen. The background picture for all of the pages is just a google search of "dark moon background."
