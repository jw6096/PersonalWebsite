# Project 4

What I would like to do for my final project is to create a game. I would like to have my first two pages to be an instructions page for how to play the game and the other page to be an about me page. The third page will be the game. The game I was thinking is very simple. I want to create a game where you must click the game repeatedly for some box to stay in the air and go through spaces of each barrier. It will keep track of your high score. Since this is just a little game, I want to the user to stay on this page for a good five minutes and say “Wow, this game is kind of fun.” Since each page needs at least one raster or vector graphic, I will include an animation of the action that is being instructed in the instructions page, the game will be the graphic itself, and the contact page is still unknown. I’m not sure what I would like to do for that. 

For this project, I need to learn how to add interactivity from the user to the game and physics. I also need to learn how to keep track of the score using cookies. I plan to learn this through the w3schools sight and the tutorials provided by the internet.
