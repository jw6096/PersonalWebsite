            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey guys, my name is Joe Wang and I'm a game designer at Rochester Institute of Technology. As a project for a web design class, I created this html game that's awfully similar to an app. :)</p>
            <p>The criteria for this project was to have three pages that fills the browser with a raster or vector graphic along with some sort of animation or motion with the graphics. Thus, this game was made.</p>
            <p>The game I created is called Flappy Cube (which is awfully similar to the title of the same app I mentioned earlier) For more instructions on how to play click on the link called
               "Flappy Cube Instructions" to get started! Also please check out my portfolio! Maybe I can provide the right skill assets for you!</p>
