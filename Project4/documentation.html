        <h1>Documentation Page</h1>
        <p>In this project, I utilized the HTML canvas to create a game based on an example from the W3Schools website.</p>
        <p>The canvas used mostly javascript to program the game. The CSS of the game is to make it look the way it is.</p>
        <p>Each of my illustration pages were based off a single foundation. I tweaked the gaps and intervals on each one. As you can see in the instructions, the gaps and bars are much larger and farther away.</p>
        <p>In the easy mode the gap is smaller than the instructions version and the hard mode is even smaller. The navigation page uses the first CSS exercise we did in class as a template.</p>
        <p>I modified it to fit the theme of the project which was sort of a Halloween theme</p>
        <p>For the above and beyond points, I decided to add audio to my pages. I had to learn how to use various other tags such as embed and audio to figure out how to implement the songs correctly and when to play and stop them.</p>
        <p>Each song is not mine and I do not own any of it. The navigation page song is called Ghed'ahre composed by Aaron Walz and is from the game Aveyond: The Orbs of Magic Series.</p>
        <p>The easy mode song is Hexenaccht by Phyrnna. The hard mode song is Demons by Zed's Dead and the instructions page song is called Underfall composed by Aaron Walz from the same game.</p>
        <p>The documentation page song takes a turn to a more epic song called Empire of Angels (Sun) composed by Thomas Bergersen.</p>
        <p>The background picture for all of the pages is just a google search of "dark moon background."</p>
